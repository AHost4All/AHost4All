                        <p>cPanel is a management tool created to help you get the maximum potential out of your hosting space. Firstly, it allows you to create and use email addresses. Nowadays, email communication has become a crucial part of any online business or project. cPanel hosting will let you set up forwarders, auto-responders and will include anti-spam tools to help you keep your inbox clean. Moreover, you will receive an easy-to-use File Manager to help you with everyday tasks. You can also create FTP users and connect to your hosting space using any FTP client. A convenient tool if you need to grant file access to a developer or colleague. Domain management tools will assist in adding more domains or subdomains to your host while controlling their DNS records at the same time. And let's not forget MySQL, which is a crucial part of many scripts and websites. cPanel hosting allows you to create MySQL databases and users with ease and has phpMyadmin to let you manage it. As a bonus, remote MySQL connections are also supported! To secure and supercharge your website, you will even have the ability to enable CloudFlare. Overall, cPanel hosting aims to encompass all the tools to start your project with a bang!</p>

                  <p>We will activate your purchased cPanel hosting package immediately after you make your payment. Keep in mind that if you use your own domain name, you will need to point it to our nameservers and wait a few hours for the DNS to propagate worldwide. In case you chose a yearly plan and registered a free domain, it may also take a few hours before the domain becomes fully functional. However, during that time you will be able to access your cPanel via server IP and start uploading or creating your project!</p>
